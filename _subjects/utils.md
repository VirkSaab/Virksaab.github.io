### FEATURE SELECTION
* Approaching almost any machine learning problem has same methods that layed out in CS229 Lecture notes by Andrew Ng - Part VII Regularization and model selection - section 2 Feature selection. The common methods are:
  1. Forward Search or feature selection by adding one new to good features list.
  2. Backward search or feature elimination means taking all features and removing one by one.
  3. Selecting top k features based on correlation score.
