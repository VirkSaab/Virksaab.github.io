**Major Project  (5 October 2018 to 22 January 2019): “GARUDA - An Android app for danger detection in the background while taking selfies”**  
This app can alert the user by detecting the level of the danger in the background while capturing selfies. It is based on a custom deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The prediction is performed as a 5 class classification problem with classes representing a different level of danger. Face detection and device orientation information are also used for robustness and lesser battery consumption. The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of a total of 22019 images collected using web scraping. Most of the images are selfies. We manually assigned a label out of 5 categories to each image.

Results: 89.28% evaluation accuracy.

**Major Project  (17 August 2018 to 15 January 2019): “Automatic Collage Maker Android App”**  
It includes an automatic collage making process of given images using a Computer Vision saliency detection algorithm as a backbone. Saliency algorithm is used to detect the salient region of an image. An energy minimization algorithm is used to position similar colour range images closer to each other so that the transition between images look smoother. The resultant collage also contains the metadata of each image, which can be used to backtrack to the original images just by touch/click on the resultant collage image.

**Major Project  (13 July 2018 to 30 December 2018): “Indian building’s rooftop detection from satellite images”**  
This work is a part of the Savera.ai’s instant rooftop mapping for the solar panel installation project. India’s satellite map resolution is less detailed, which makes rooftops’ detection harder. It includes detection of roofs from the low-resolution satellite view of Google Maps, Image Segmentation using deep neural network based on U-Net architecture, TensorFlow, and Python 3.5. The dataset used in this project belongs to the Savera.ai team. [Code](https://github.com/SaveraLLC/Indian-rooftops-detection)

**Minor Project  (30 March, 2018 to 15 May, 2018): “Road Lane detection in real-time GTA 5 Video Game”**  
This project runs on windows only due to the GTA 5 Game. It includes real-time lane detection while driving a car in the game. It uses Computer Vision on low resolution images obtained by screen grabbing script to detect the color of the lanes and postprocessing like thresholding, dilation, etc. to improve the results. [Code](https://github.com/VirkSaab/Lane-detection-in-GTA-5-Video-Game)

**Minor Project  (15 February, 2018 to 20 March, 2018): “Face Recognition and Verification using Deep Learning and Transfer Learning”**  
This project includes LFW dataset for evaluation, image face alignment preprocessing with Joint Face Detection and Alignment using Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Networks(MTCNN), pretrained FaceNet(with Inception ResNet v1 model), Tensorflow-gpu with Python 3 on Ubuntu 16.04.  

**Major Project  (1 February 2017 to 11 April 2017): “Sentiment analysis on twitter data using Apache Pig, MapReduce, HDFS, Apache Flume and AFINN Dictionary”**  
Sentiment analysis is extremely useful in social media monitoring as it allows to gain an overview of the wider public opinion behind certain topics. First, Twitter data was pulled using Apache Flume with the help of Twitter streaming API to HDFS sink. Further, Apache Pig was used to load data for analysis. AFINN Dictionary was used for connotating words used in tweets and rate them as positive or negative. Finally, tweets were labelled as positive or negative according to AFINN Dictionary word rating. [Code](https://github.com/VirkSaab/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis)

**Major Project  (25 October 2016 to 15 December 2016): “Teacher Review System”**  
The Objective of this project is to rate a teacher corresponding to his/her teaching techniques in lectures on a scale of less interesting to highly interesting. We used Support Vector Classifier (Machine Learning algorithm) to classify face expression images, Template Matching and Face Detection (Computer vision algorithms), and Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) features (Automatic Speech Recognition algorithm) extracted from teacher’s speech. [Code](https://github.com/VirkSaab/Teacher-Review-System)

**Minor Project  (1 March 2016 to 20 May 2016): “Home Automation System”**  
Hardware includes Arduino Uno R3 Microcontroller, five sensors (light, motion, temperature, gas, and sound), buzzer, LED lights, crystal display and Software include Arduino IDE 1.6.8 and C programming language. Home automation is a residential extension of building automation and involves the control of lights, temperature sensing, appliances, and security. Security sensors such as motion detector and gas sensor interact with buzzer and LED. The display unit provides temperature information and special messages.
