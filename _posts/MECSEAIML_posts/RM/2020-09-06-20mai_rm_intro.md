## What is Research?
Research is an organized inquiry designed and carried out to provide information for solving a problem. In other words, research is a systematic investigation (i.e., the gathering and analysis of data) designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. The National academy of sciences states that the objective of the research is to extend human understanding of the physical, biological, or social world beyond what is already known. Research is different than other forms of discovering knowledge (like reading a book) because it uses a systematic process called the Scientific Method.
Research is systematic, because it follows certain steps that are logical in order. These steps are-
1. Understanding the nature of problem to be studied and identifying the related area of
knowledge.
2. Reviewing literature to understand how others have approached or dealt with the problem.
3. Collecting data in an organized and controlled manner so as to arrive at valid decisions.
4. Analyzing data appropriate to the problem.
5. Drawing conclusions and making generalizations.

## The Scientific Method
<img src="/assets/20MAI/RM/scientific_method.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="Scientific Method image" style="max-height: 30rem;">
The Scientific Method consists of observing the world around you and creating a hypothesis about relationships in the world. A hypothesis is an informed and educated prediction or explanation about something. Part of the research process involves testing the hypothesis and then examining the results of these tests as they relate to both the hypothesis and the world around you. When a researcher forms a hypothesis, this acts as a map through the research study. It tells the researcher which factors are important to study and how they might be related to each other or caused by a manipulation that the researcher introduces (e.g. a program, treatment or change in the environment). With this map, the researcher can interpret the information he/she collects and can make sound conclusions about the results.

Research can be done with human beings, animals, plants, other organisms and inorganic matter. When research is done with human beings and animals, it must follow specific rules about the treatment of humans and animals that have been created by the U.S. Federal Government. This ensures that humans and animals are treated with dignity and respect and that the research causes minimal harm.

No matter what topic is being studied, the value of the research depends on how well it is designed and done. Therefore, one of the most critical considerations in doing good research is to follow the design or plan that is developed by an experienced researcher who is called the [Principal Investigator (PI)](https://ori.hhs.gov/content/basic-research-concepts-additional-sections#pi). The PI is in charge of all aspects of the research and creates what is called a [protocol](https://ori.hhs.gov/content/basic-research-concepts-additional-sections#prot) (the research plan) that all people doing the research must follow. By doing so, the PI and the public can be sure that the results of the research are real and useful to other scientists.

## Meaning of research
Research, in general, refers to a search for knowledge. It may be defined as a scientific and systematic search for relevant information on a specific topic or area. In other words, research is an art of scientific investigation. The Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English lays down the meaning of research as *a careful investigation or inquiry, especially through search for new facts in any branch of knowledge*. Redman and Mory define research as *a systematic effort to gain new knowledge*. Some people consider research as a movement, a movement from known to unknown. It is actually a voyage of discovery. Clifford Woody defines research as a comprises defining and redefining problems, formulating hypothesis or suggested solutions; collecting, organizing and evaluating data; making deductions and reaching conclusions; and at last, carefully testing the conclusions to determine whether they fit the formulating hypothesis.


## Purpose of Research

**Definition**: The research purpose is a statement of "why" the study is being conducted, or the goal of the study. The goal of a study might be to identify or describe a concept or to explain or predict a situation or solution to a situation that indicates the type of study to be conducted (Beckingham, 1974).

The purpose statement identifies the variables, population and setting for a study. Every study has an explicit or implicit purpose statement. The research purpose should be stated objectively or in a way that does not reflect particular biases or values of the researcher. Researchers which do not recognize their values might include their biases in their research. In the research process, the purpose is usually stated after the problem, supports the problem and clarifies the knowledge to be generated for nursing.

**Examples of the Research Problem and Purpose**:

**Topic**: Sleep patterns, Ageing process

**Problem**: Because of the lack of norms (for changes in sleep patterns with age), nurses and patients tend to evaluate a hospitalized older person's sleep on the basis of sleep norms for younger adults.

**Purpose**: The purpose of this study was to determine the nature of sleep behaviors among hospitalized older persons of different ages.


## Objectives of research
The main objective of research work is to find out the hidden facts yet to be discovered. I general, research objectives describe what we expect to achieve by a project or study. Though each research study has its own specific purpose, we may think of research objective as falling into a number of following broad groupings:
1. **Exploratory or formulative research studies**: To gain familiarity with a phenomenon or to achieve new insights into it;
2. **Descriptive research studies**: To describe accurately the characteristics of a particular individual, situation or a group;
3. **Diagnostic research studies**: To determine the frequency with which something occurs or with which it is associated with something else;
4. **Hypothesis-testing research studies**: To test a hypothesis of a casual relationship between variables.

## Motivation in research
What makes people to undertake research? This is a question of fundamental importance. The possible motives for doing research may be either one or more of the following:
1. Desire to get a research degree along with its consequential benefits;
2. Desire to face the challenge in solving the unsolved problems, i.e., concern over practical problems initiates research;
3. Desire to get intellectual joy of doing some creative work;
4. Desire to be of service to society;
5. Desire to get respectability.

However, this is not an exhaustive list of factors motivating people to undertake research studies. Many more factors such as directives of government, employment conditions, curiosity about new
things, desire to understand causal relationships, social thinking and awakening, and the like may as well motivate (or at times compel) people to perform research operations.

## Significance of Research
“All progress is born of inquiry. Doubt is often better than overconfidence, for it leads to inquiry, and inquiry leads to invention” is a famous Hudson Maxim in context of which the significance of research can well be understood. Increased amounts of research make progress possible. Research inculcates scientific and inductive thinking and it promotes the development of logical habits of thinking and organization.
* The role of research in several fields of applied economics, whether related to business or to the economy as a whole, has greatly increased in modern times.
* Research provides the basis for nearly all government policies in our economic system. For instance, government’s budgets rest in part on an analysis of the needs and desires of the people and on the availability of revenues to meet these needs.
* Research has its special significance in solving various operational and planning problems of business and industry. Operations research and market research, along with motivational research, are considered crucial and their results assist, in more than one way, in taking business decisions.
* Research is equally important for social scientists in studying social relationships and in seeking answers to various social problems. Research in social sciences is concerned both with knowledge for its own sake and with knowledge for what it can contribute to practical concerns.

In addition to what has been stated above, the significance of research can also be understood keeping in view the following points:
* To those students who are to write a master’s or Ph.D. thesis, research may mean a careerism or a way to attain a high position in the social structure;
* To professionals in research methodology, research may mean a source of livelihood;
* To philosophers and thinkers, research may mean the outlet for new ideas and insights;
* To literary men and women, research may mean the development of new styles and creative work;
* To analysts and intellectuals, research may mean the generalisations of new theories.

Thus, research is the fountain of knowledge for the sake of knowledge and an important source of providing guidelines for solving different business, governmental and social problems. It is a sort of formal training which enables one to understand the new developments in one’s field in a better way.

## Steps to Follow When Conducting Research
The specific steps to follow when conducting research depend, in part, on the topic of investigation, where the researchers are in their overall program of research, and other factors. Nonetheless, it is accurate to say that much research in the social sciences follows a systematic course of action that begins with the statement of a research question and ends with the researcher drawing conclusions about a null hypothesis. The research process as a planned sequence that consists of the following six steps:

* Developing a statement of the research question
* Developing a statement of the research hypothesis
* Defining the instrument (questionnaire, unobtrusive measures)
* Gathering the data
* Analyzing the data
* Drawing conclusions regarding the hypothesis

The preceding steps reference a fictitious research problem. Imagine that you have been hired by a large insurance company to find ways of improving the productivity of its insurance agents. Specifically, the company would like you to find ways to increase the dollar amount of insurance policies sold by the average agent. You begin a program of research to identify the determinants of agent productivity.

## Applications of Research
[WRITE APPLICATIONS HERE]

## Characteristics of Research
Research is a process through which we attempt to achieve systematically and with the support of data the answer to a question, the resolution of a problem, or a greater understanding of a phenomenon. This process has eight distinct characteristics.

**Research…**

* Originates with a question or problem.
* Requires a clear articulation of a goal.
* Follows a specific plan of procedure.
* Usually divides the principal problem into more manageable sub-problems.
* Is guided by the specific research problem, question, or hypothesis.
* Accepts certain critical assumptions.
* Requires the collection and interpretation of data in attempting to resolve the problem that initiated the research.
* Is by its nature, cyclical; or more exactly, helical.

## Types of research
The basic types of research are as follows:
1. **Descriptive vs. Analytical**: Descriptive research includes surveys and fact-finding enquiries of different kinds. The major purpose of descriptive research is description of the state of affairs as it exists at present. In social science and business research we quite often use the term Ex post facto, which means after the fact, research for descriptive research studies. The main characteristic of this method is that the researcher has no control over the variables; he can only report what has happened or what is happening. Most ex post facto research projects are used for descriptive studies in which the researcher seeks to measure such items as, for example, frequency of shopping, preferences of people, or similar data. Ex post facto studies also include attempts by researchers to discover causes even when they cannot control the variables. The methods of research utilized in descriptive research are survey methods of all kinds, including comparative and correlational methods. In analytical research, on the other hand, the researcher has to use facts or information already available, and analyze these to make a critical evaluation of the material.

2. **Applied vs. Fundamental**: Research can either be applied (or action) research or fundamental (to basic or pure) research. Applied research aims at finding a solution for an immediate problem facing a society or an industrial/business organisation, whereas fundamental research is mainly concerned with generalisations and with the formulation of a theory. “Gathering knowledge for knowledge’s sake is termed ‘pure’ or ‘basic’ research.” Research concerning some natural phenomenon or relating to pure mathematics are examples of fundamental research. Similarly, research studies, concerning human behaviour carried on with a view to make generalisations about human behaviour, are also examples of fundamental research, but research aimed at certain conclusions (say, a solution) facing a concrete social or business problem is an example of applied research. Research to identify social, economic or political trends that may affect a particular institution or the copy research (research to find out whether certain communications will be read and understood) or the marketing research or evaluation research are examples of applied research. Thus, the central aim of applied research is to discover a solution for some pressing practical problem, whereas basic research is directed towards finding information that has a broad base of applications and thus, adds to the already existing organized body of scientific knowledge.

3. **Quantitative vs. Qualitative**: Quantitative research is based on the measurement of quantity or amount. It is applicable to phenomena that can be expressed in terms of quantity. Qualitative research, on the other hand, is concerned with qualitative phenomenon, i.e., phenomena relating to or involving quality or kind. For instance, when we are interested in investigating the reasons for human behaviour (i.e., why people think or do certain things), we quite often talk of ‘Motivation Research’, an important type of qualitative research. This type of research aims at discovering the underlying motives and desires, using in depth interviews for the purpose. Other techniques of such research are word association tests, sentence completion tests, story completion tests and similar other projective techniques. Attitude or opinion research i.e., research designed to find out how people feel or what they think about a particular subject or institution is also qualitative research. Qualitative research is specially important in the behavioural sciences where the aim is to discover the underlying motives of human behaviour. Through such research we can analyse the various factors which motivate people to behave in a particular manner or which make people like or dislike a particular thing. It may be stated, however, that to apply qualitative research in practice is relatively a difficult job and therefore, while doing such research, one should seek guidance from experimental psychologists.

4. **Conceptual vs. Empirical**: Conceptual research is that related to some abstract idea(s) or theory. It is generally used by philosophers and thinkers to develop new concepts or to reinterpret existing ones. On the other hand, empirical research relies on experience or observation alone, often without due regard for system and theory. It is data-based research,
coming up with conclusions which are capable of being verified by observation or experiment. We can also call it as experimental type of research. In such a research it is necessary to get at facts firsthand, at their source, and actively to go about doing certain things to stimulate the production of desired information. In such a research, the researcher must first provide himself with a working hypothesis or guess as to the probable results. He then works to get enough facts (data) to prove or disprove his hypothesis. He then sets up experimental designs which he thinks will manipulate the persons or the materials concerned so as to bring forth the desired information. Such research is thus characterized by the experimenter’s control over the variables under study and his deliberate manipulation of one of them to study its effects. Empirical research is appropriate when proof is sought that certain variables affect other variables in some way. Evidence gathered through experiments or empirical studies is today considered to be the most powerful support possible for a given hypothesis.

#### Other types of research
All other types of research are variations of one or more of the above stated approaches, based on either the purpose of research, or the time required to accomplish research, on the environment in which research is done, or on the basis of some other similar factor.
* Research that is confined to a single time period is callled **one-time research**
* Research that carried on over several time-periods is called **longitudinal research**.
  * Trend study - looks at population characteristics over time, e.g. organizational absenteeism rates during the course of a year
  * Cohort study - traces a sub-population over time, e.g. absenteeism rates for the sales department;
  * Panel study - traces the same sample over time, e.g. graduate career tracks over the period 1990 – 2000 for the same starting cohort.
* Research can be **field-setting** research or **laboratory** research or **simulation** research, depending upon the environment in which it is to be carried out.
* **Clinical or diagnostic research** follow case-study methods or indepth approaches to reach the basic causal relations.
* **Historical research** is that which utilizes historical sources like documents, remains, etc. to study events or ideas of the past, including the philosophy of persons and groups at any remote point of time.
* Research can also be classified as conclusion-oriented and decision-oriented. While doing **conclusion oriented research**, a researcher is free to pick up a problem, redesign the enquiry as he proceeds and is prepared to conceptualize as he wishes. **Decision-oriented research** is
always for the need of a decision maker and the researcher in this case is not free to embark upon research according to his own inclination. Operations research is an example of decision oriented research since it is a scientific method of providing executive departments with a quantitative basis for decisions regarding operations under their control.
* **Cross-sectional Research**: One-shot or cross-sectional studies are those in which data is gathered once, during a period of days, weeks or months. Many cross-sectional studies are exploratory or descriptive in purpose. They are designed to look at how things are now, without any sense of whether there is a history or trend at work.
* Fact findings to improve the quality of action in the social world is known as **action research**.
* Reports employing **policy-oriented research** focus on the question *How can problem X be solved or prevented?*.
* **Classification research** aims at categorization of units in to groups and to explain their relationships.
* **Comparative research** involves the identification of similarities and differences between units at all levels.
* **Casual research** aims at establishing cause and effect relationship among variables.
* **Theory-testing research**: Theory testing is primarily applied by the graduate student, as the name suggests, to test whether a certain theory of his choosing is a plausible explanation of a phenomenon he would like to investigate. To clarify the concept of theory testing, take the case of the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) Theory. Anthropogenic refers to human-derived greenhouse gas emissions that are believed to be the main reason for the observed global warming in recent years. Carbon dioxide comprises one of the greenhouse gasses. Carbon dioxide causes water on the surface of the earth to evaporate. Increased water vapor in the atmosphere can trap heat coming from the earth thus cause global warming.
* **Theory-building research**: Theory building requires the synthesis of a broad range of literature and studies to provide evidence or confirm explanations to a given phenomenon. Theory building is the graduate student’s or a veteran scientist’s attempt to explain something plausibly in a different light or perspective.

## Research Approaches
The above description of the types of research brings to light the fact that there are two basic approaches to research, viz., quantitative approach and the qualitative approach. The former involves the generation of data in quantitative form which can be subjected to rigorous quantitative analysis in a formal and rigid fashion. This approach can be further sub-classified into inferential, experimental and simulation approaches to research. The purpose of inferential approach to research is to form a data base from which to infer characteristics or relationships of population. This usually means survey research where a sample of population is studied (questioned or observed) to determine its characteristics, and it is then inferred that the population has the same characteristics. Experimental approach is characterised by much greater control over the research environment and in this case some variables are manipulated to observe their effect on other variables. Simulation approach involves the construction of an artificial environment within which relevant information
and data can be generated. This permits an observation of the dynamic behaviour of a system (or its sub-system) under controlled conditions. The term ‘simulation’ in the context of business and social sciences applications refers to “the operation of a numerical model that represents the structure of a dynamic process. Given the values of initial conditions, parameters and exogenous variables, a simulation is run to represent the behaviour of the process over time.” Simulation approach can also
be useful in building models for understanding future conditions.
Qualitative approach to research is concerned with subjective assessment of attitudes, opinions and behaviour. Research in such a situation is a function of researcher’s insights and impressions.
Such an approach to research generates results either in non-quantitative form or in the form which are not subjected to rigorous quantitative analysis. Generally, the techniques of focus group interviews, projective techniques and depth interviews are used. All these are explained at length in chapters that follow.

## Research Methods versus Methodology
The research methods are often confused with research methodology, which implies the scientific analysis of the research methods, so as to find a solution to the problem at hand.

**Research methods** may be understood as all those methods/techniques that are used for conduction of research. Research methods or techniques*, thus, refer to the methods the researchers use in performing research operations. In other words, all those methods which are used by the
researcher during the course of studying his research problem are termed as research methods.

**Research methodology** is a way to systematically solve the research problem. It may be understood as a science of studying how research is done scientifically. In it we study the various steps that are generally adopted by a researcher in studying his research problem along with the logic behind them. It is necessary for the researcher to know not only the research methods/techniques but also the methodology. Researchers not only need to know how to develop certain indices or tests, how to calculate the mean, the mode, the median or the standard deviation or chi-square, how to apply particular research techniques, but they also need to know which of these methods or techniques, are relevant and which are not, and what would they mean and indicate and why. Researchers also need to understand the assumptions underlying various techniques and they need to know the criteria by which they can decide that certain techniques and procedures will be applicable to certain problems and others will not. All this means that it is necessary for the researcher to design his methodology for his problem as the same may differ from problem to problem. For example, an architect, who designs a building, has to consciously evaluate the basis of his decisions, i.e., he has to evaluate why and on what basis he selects particular size, number and location of doors, windows and ventilators, uses particular materials and not others and the like. Similarly, in research the scientist has to expose the research decisions to evaluation before they are implemented. He has to specify very clearly and precisely what decisions he selects and why he selects them so that they can be evaluated by others also.

<p style="background: #eeeeee;">
* At times, a distinction is also made between research techniques and research methods. Research techniques refer to
the behaviour and instruments we use in performing research operations such as making observations, recording data,
techniques of processing data and the like. Research methods refer to the behaviour and instruments used in selecting and
constructing research technique. For instance, the difference between methods and techniques of data collection can better
be understood from the details given in the following chart —

In conclusion, the scope of research methodology is wider than that of research method, as the latter is the part of the former. For understanding the research problem thoroughly, the researcher should know the research methodology along with the methods.

In a nutshell, research method refers to the technique which can be adopted to explore the nature of the world that surrounds us. On the contrary, research methodology is the foundation, which helps us to understand the determinants influencing the effectiveness of the methods applied.

## Criteria of Good Research
Whatever may be the types of research works and studies, one thing that is important is that they all meet on the common ground of scientific method employed by them. One expects scientific research to satisfy the following criteria:
1. The purpose of the research should be clearly defined and common concepts be used.
2. The research procedure used should be described in sufficient detail to permit another researcher to repeat the research for further advancement, keeping the continuity of what has already been attained.
3. The procedural design of the research should be carefully planned to yield results that are as objective as possible.
4. The researcher should report with complete frankness, flaws in procedural design and estimate their effects upon the findings.
5. The analysis of data should be sufficiently adequate to reveal its significance and the methods of analysis used should be appropriate. The validity and reliability of the data should be checked carefully.
6. Conclusions should be confined to those justified by the data of the research and limited to those for which the data provide an adequate basis.
7. Greater confidence in research is warranted if the researcher is experienced, has a good reputation in research and is a person of integrity.

In other words, we can state the qualities of a good research as under:
1. *Good research is systematic*: It means that research is structured with specified steps to
be taken in a specified sequence in accordance with the well defined set of rules. Systematic
characteristic of the research does not rule out creative thinking but it certainly does reject
the use of guessing and intuition in arriving at conclusions.
2. *Good research is logical*: This implies that research is guided by the rules of logical
reasoning and the logical process of induction and deduction are of great value in carrying
out research. Induction is the process of reasoning from a part to the whole whereas
deduction is the process of reasoning from some premise to a conclusion which follows
from that very premise. In fact, logical reasoning makes research more meaningful in the
context of decision making.
3. *Good research is empirical*: It implies that research is related basically to one or more
aspects of a real situation and deals with concrete data that provides a basis for external
validity to research results.
4. *Good research is replicable*: This characteristic allows research results to be verified by
replicating the study and thereby building a sound basis for decisions.

## Research Process
Research process consists of series of actions or steps necessary to effectively carry out research and the desired sequencing of these steps. The chart shown in Figure well illustrates a research process.

<img src="/assets/20MAI/RM/research_process.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="Research process" style="max-width: 97%;">

The following order concerning various steps provides a useful procedural guideline regarding the research process:
1. Define research problem
2. Review the literature
3. Formulate hypothesis
4. Preparing the research design
5. Data collection
6. Data analysis
7. Interpretation and report writing

Where f = feed-back (helps in controlling the sub system and ff = feed-forward(serves the vital function of providing criteria for evaluation.

A brief description of the above stated steps will be helpful.

#### Define Research Problem
There are two types of research problems, viz., those which relate to states of nature and those which relate to relationships between variables. At the very outset the researcher must single out the problem he wants to study, i.e., he must decide the general area of interest or aspect of a subject matter that he would like to inquire into. Initially the problem may be stated in a broad general way and then the ambiguities, if any, relating to the problem be resolved. Then, the feasibility of a particular solution has to be considered before a working formulation of the problem can be set up. The formulation of a general topic into a specific research problem, thus, constitutes the first step in a scientific enquiry. Essentially two steps are involved in formulating the research problem, viz., understanding the problem thoroughly, and rephrasing the same into meaningful terms from an analytical point of view.

#### Review the literature
Once the problem is formulated, a brief summary of it should be written down. It is compulsory for a research worker writing a thesis for a Ph.D. degree to write a synopsis of the topic and submit it to the necessary Committee or the Research Board for approval. At this juncture the researcher should undertake extensive literature survey connected with the problem. For this purpose, the abstracting and indexing journals and published or unpublished bibliographies are the first place to go to. Academic journals, conference proceedings, government reports, books etc., must be tapped depending on the nature of the problem. In this process, it should be remembered that one source will lead to another. The earlier studies, if any, which are similar to the study in hand should be carefully studied. A good library will be a great help to the researcher at this stage.

#### Formulate hypothesis
After extensive literature survey, researcher should state in clear terms the working hypothesis or hypotheses. Working hypothesis is tentative assumption made in order to draw out and test its logical or empirical consequences. As such the manner in which research hypotheses are developed is particularly important since they provide the focal point for research. They also affect the manner in which tests must be conducted in the analysis of data and indirectly the quality of data which is required for the analysis. In most types of research, the development of working hypothesis plays an important role. Hypothesis should be very specific and limited to the piece of research in hand because it has to be tested. The role of the hypothesis is to guide the researcher by delimiting the area of research and to keep him on the right track. It sharpens his thinking and focuses attention on the more important facets of the problem. It also indicates the type of data required and the type of methods of data analysis to be used. How does one go about developing working hypotheses? The answer is by using the following
approach:
  * Discussions with colleagues and experts about the problem, its origin and the objectives in
seeking a solution;
  * Examination of data and records, if available, concerning the problem for possible trends,
peculiarities and other clues;
  * Review of similar studies in the area or of the studies on similar problems; and
  * Exploratory personal investigation which involves original field interviews on a limited scale with interested parties and individuals with a view to secure greater insight into the practical aspects of the problem.

#### Preparing the research design
There are several research designs, such as, experimental and non-experimental hypothesis testing. Experimental designs can be either informal designs (such as before-and-after without control, after-only with control, before and-after with control) or formal designs (such as completely randomized design, randomized block design, Latin square design, simple and complex factorial designs), out of which the researcher must select one for his own project. The preparation of the research design, appropriate for a particular research problem, involves usually the consideration of the following:
* the means of obtaining the information
* the availability and skills of the researcher and his staff (if any)
* explanation of the way in which selected means of obtaining information will be organised
and the reasoning leading to the selection;
* the time available for research, and
* the cost factor relating to research, i.e., the finance available for the purpose.

#### Data Collection
In dealing with any real life problem it is often found that data at hand are inadequate, and hence, it becomes necessary to collect data that are appropriate. There are several ways of collecting the appropriate data which differ considerably in context of money costs, time and other resources at the disposal of the researcher. Primary data can be collected either through experiment or through survey. If the researcher conducts an experiment, he observes some quantitative measurements, or the data, with the help of which he examines the truth contained in his hypothesis. But in the case of a survey, data can be collected by any one or more of the following ways:
  * By observation
  * Through personal interview
  * Through telephone interview
  * By mailing of questionnaires
  * Through schedules

The researcher should select one of these methods of collecting the data taking into consideration the nature of investigation, objective and scope of the inquiry, finanical resources, available time and the desired degree of accuracy. Though he should pay attention to all these factors but much depends upon the ability and experience of the researcher.

#### Data Analysis
After the data have been collected, the researcher turns to the task of analysing them. The analysis of data requires a number of closely related operations such as establishment of categories, the application of these categories to raw data through coding, tabulation and then drawing statistical inferences. The unwieldy data should necessarily be condensed into a few manageable groups and tables for further analysis. Thus, researcher should classify the raw data into some purposeful and usable categories. **Coding** operation is usually done at this stage through which the categories of data are transformed into symbols that may be tabulated and counted. **Editing** is the procedure that improves the quality of the data for coding. With coding the stage is ready for tabulation. **Tabulation** is a part of the technical procedure wherein the classified data are put in the form of tables. The mechanical devices can be made use of at this juncture. A great deal of data, specially in large inquiries, is tabulated by computers. Computers not only save time but also make it possible to study large number of variables affecting a problem simultaneously.

Analysis work after tabulation is generally based on the computation of various percentages, coefficients, etc., by applying various well defined statistical formulae. In the process of analysis, relationships or differences supporting or conflicting with original or new hypotheses should be subjected to tests of significance to determine with what validity data can be said to indicate any conclusion(s). For instance, if there are two samples of weekly wages, each sample being drawn from factories in different parts of the same city, giving two different mean values, then our problem may be whether the two mean values are significantly different or the difference is just a matter of chance. In brief, the researcher can analyse the collected data with the help of various statistical measures.


#### Interpretation and report writing
**Hypothesis-testing**: After analysing the data as state above, the researcher is in a position to test the hypotheses, if any, he had formulated earlier. Do the facts support the hypotheses or they happen to be contrary? This is the usual question which should be answered while testing hypotheses. Various tests, such as Chi square test, t-test, F-test, have been developed by statisticians for the purpose. The hypotheses may be tested through the use of one or more of such tests, depending upon the nature and object of research inquiry. Hypothesis-testing will result in either accepting the hypothesis or in rejecting it. If the researcher had no hypotheses to start with, generalisations established on the basis of data may be stated as hypotheses to be tested by subsequent researches in times to come.

**Generalisations and interpretation**: If a hypothesis is tested and upheld several times, it may be possible for the researcher to arrive at generalisation, i.e., to build a theory. As a matter of fact, the real value of research lies in its ability to arrive at certain generalisations. If the researcher had no hypothesis to start with, he might seek to explain his findings on the basis of some theory. It is known as interpretation. The process of interpretation may quite often trigger off new questions which in turn may lead to further researches.

**Preparation of the report or the thesis**: Finally, the researcher has to prepare the report of what has been done by him. Writing of report must be done with great care keeping in view the following:
1. The layout of the report should be as follows: (i) the preliminary pages; (ii) the main text, and (iii) the end matter. In its preliminary pages the report should carry title and date followed by acknowledgements and foreword. Then there should be a table of contents followed by a list of tables and list of graphs and charts, if any, given in the report. The main text of the report should have the following parts:
  * *Introduction*: It should contain a clear statement of the objective of the research and an explanation of the methodology adopted in accomplishing the research. The scope of the study along with various limitations should as well be stated in this part.
  * *Summary of findings*: After introduction there would appear a statement of findings and recommendations in non-technical language. If the findings are extensive, they should be summarised.
  * *Main report*: The main body of the report should be presented in logical sequence and broken-down into readily identifiable sections.
  * *Conclusion*: Towards the end of the main text, researcher should again put down the results of his research clearly and precisely. In fact, it is the final summing up.

2. Report should be written in a concise and objective style in simple language avoiding vague expressions such as ‘it seems,’ ‘there may be’, and the like.
3. Charts and illustrations in the main report should be used only if they present the information more clearly and forcibly.
4. Calculated ‘confidence limits’ must be mentioned and the various constraints experienced in conducting research operations may as well be stated.
