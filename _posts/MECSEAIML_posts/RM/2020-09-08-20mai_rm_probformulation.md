Before you start any form of study, get a clear understanding of what a research problem is and learn to formulate it properly. To define a problem correctly, a researcher must know: what a problem is?

## What is a research problem?
A research problem, in general, refers to some difficulty which a researcher experiences in the context of either a theoretical or practical situation and wants to obtain a solution for the same. Usually we say that a research problem does exist if the following conditions are met with:
* There must be an individual (or a group or an organisation), let us call it ‘I,’ to whom the problem can be attributed. The individual or the organisation, as the case may be, occupies an environment, say ‘N’, which is defined by values of the uncontrolled variables, Y<sub>j</sub>.
* There must be at least two courses of action, say C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> , to be pursued. A course of action is defined by one or more values of the controlled variables. For example, the number of items purchased at a specified time is said to be one course of action.
* There must be at least two possible outcomes, say O<sub>1</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> , of the course of action, of which one should be preferable to the other. In other words, this means that there must be at least one outcome that the researcher wants, i.e., an objective.
* The courses of action available must provides some chance of obtaining the objective, but they cannot provide the same chance, otherwise the choice would not matter. Thus, if $$P (O_j \vert I, C_j , N)$$ represents the probability that an outcome O<sub>j</sub> will occur, if I select C<sub>j</sub> in N, then $$P (O_1 \vert I , C_1 , N) ≠ P (O_1 \vert I , C_2 , N)$$. In simple words, we can say that the choices must have unequal efficiencies for the desired outcomes.

viz. **A research problem** is a statement about an area of concern, a condition to be improved, a difficulty to be eliminated, or a troubling question that exists in scholarly literature, in theory, or in practice that points to the need for meaningful understanding and deliberate investigation. In some social science disciplines the research problem is typically posed in the form of a question. A research problem does not state how to do something, offer a vague or broad proposition, or present a value question. However, it is important to remember that not all questions can be transformed into research problems and some may prove to be extremely difficult to study.

Thus, a research problem is one which requires a researcher to find out the best solution for the given problem, i.e., to find out by which course of action the objective can be attained optimally in the context of a given environment. There are several factors which may result in making the problem complicated. For instance, the environment may change affecting the efficiencies of the courses of action or the values of the outcomes; the number of alternative courses of action may be very large; persons not involved in making the decision may be affected by it and react to it favourably or unfavourably, and similar other factors. All such elements (or at least the important ones) may be thought of in context of a research problem.

#### The purpose of a problem statement is to:

* Introduce the reader to the importance of the topic being studied. The reader is oriented to the significance of the study and the research questions or hypotheses to follow.
* Places the problem into a particular context that defines the parameters of what is to be investigated.
* Provides the framework for reporting the results and indicates what is probably necessary to conduct the study and explain how the findings will present this information.


#### How to identify a research problem?
After choosing a specific topic for your academic paper, you need to state it as a clear research problem that identifies all the issues that you’ll address. It’s not always simple for students to formulate it. In some fields, they may end up spending a lot of time thinking, exploring, and studying before getting a clear idea of what research questions to answer. Some topics are too broad to give a researchable issue. For example, if you decide to study certain social issues, like child poverty, remember that they don’t provide any researchable question. These are very broad to address and take a lot of time and resources to become unfeasible so that your study will lack enough focus and depth.

#### What is a statement of a research problem?
An adequate statement of your research problem plays an important role in the success of your academic paper and study. It’s possible to generate a number of researchable issues from the same subject because there are many issues that may arise out of it. Your study should pursue only one in detail.

#### Basic characteristics of research problem
For your research problem to be effective, make sure that it has these basic characteristics:
* Reflecting on important issues or needs
* Basing on factual evidence (it’s non-hypothetical)
* Being manageable and relevant
* Suggesting a testable and meaningful hypothesis (avoiding useless answers)

#### How do we get from the research problem to researchable questions?
Arriving at specific research objectives, questions or hypotheses from an idea or problem is a highly personalised activity - there are different ways of doing it and we all do it differently. Below is one suggestion based around the idea of 'brainstorming'. The results of this process can be displayed in the form of a 'spider diagram' or mental map of ideas and themes related to your research idea. The resulting conceptual map can serve both as a starting point and as a conceptual framework for your investigation.

##### Conceptual frameworks
A common tactic here is to 'unpack' your idea or problem thus generating a range of possibilities before narrowing down on one or two themes. Following the suggestions of Punch (1998) steps could be:
1. write down the all the concepts involved, and all the sub-questions you can think of pertaining to the issue. Reading around your research idea will help to generate questions and information and to identify themes and potential information sources
2. subdivide your questions where possible; split wide general questions into smaller ones
3. begin to order questions and develop focus: group questions together under common themes, separate general and specific questions
4. start to trim by selecting those questions that you wish to deal with, consider the resources that will be available to you
5. collate these thoughts within a loose conceptual framework - this shows how questions and themes are related and may help guide your thinking at a later stage.

This process of thinking wide and then focusing and delimiting your questions, should result in a handful of research questions that you wish to investigate. These may still need further modification to render them answerable; they may need to be operationalised.

Note: there are no right or wrong answers in such an exercise, the purpose is to get you thinking about as many facets of your research idea as possible. It should also cause you to question some of the concepts you might previously have accepted as given.


***Let's take an example of Social Research to understand research problem in more details:***

**Formulation of Social Research Problem** refers to state the problem in a researchable manner. It means to  portray the topic in a way that it  becomes ready for scientific investigation. A research problem is simply  research topic. The researcher needs to refine the topic and clearly state what  is intended to explore about the topic.  Formulation of the research problem basically includes narrowing down the  research area and formulating the objectives. Once the research problem is  formulated, the topic becomes ready to undergo a scientific inquiry *-- the research*.

The formulation of a research problem consists of the following steps:
* **Identify a broad research area of your interest**: A research always starts with  identifying a broad research area depending on his interest, knowledge,  specialty, expertise and profession. Hence, you should first select a major  area which you want to investigate. Such an area must have a wide significance  and must be according to your interest, knowledge  and specialty. For instance, a researcher in social science may select areas  such as poverty reduction, overpopulation,  conflict resolution, crime control, unemployment, political instability,  economic fluctuations, human rights, justice  system, familial issues, cultural practices, social and religious  fragmentations, domestic violence and so on. These are broad areas. Each of  these areas can be split into many research topics.

* **Disect the broad area into sub-areas**: Once you select a broad area,  you need to narrow down the area into a specific topic that is researchable and  manageable for the researcher.  For this,  dissect the broad area into sub-areas to select one specific topic from them.  For instance, you have selected a broad area **Domestic Violence (DV)** for your  research. This broad area can be split into following sub-areas:
  * Profile of families in which DV occurs
  * Profile of victim of DV
  * Profile of <span class="text-primary" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right" title="a person who carries out a harmful, illegal, or immoral act.">perpetrator</span>
  * Causes of DV
  * Types of DV
  * Impact of DV on family
  * Impact of DV on children
  * Services available to the victim of DV
  * Effectiveness of the services provided to the victim of DV
  * Extent of DV in a community

* **Select one of the sub-areas**: It is not feasible for the  researcher to study all the sub-areas due to limited resources -- *time and monetary resources*. Hence, select one the sub-area that interest you more and is more feasible and manageable for you. This area should be relevant to your subject knowledge. It should also have research significance.

* **Raise research questions**: After selecting a specific sub-area, start thinking about  what should you explore about this sub-area (topic). In other words, raise  important questions about the chosen sub-area which need to be answered in your  research. There can be many questions but you have to choose the most important  and relevant ones. Similarly, the number question will determine the length of  your research and thesis. Hence, make a  few questions depending upon the length of your research. For instance, we select one sub-area from the above that is **cause of domestic violence**. We may raise the following questions:
  1. How does illiteracy influence DV?
  2. Is poverty responsible for DV?
  3. How do long-held traditions lead to DV?
  4. What are the socio-cultural causes of DV?

  Similarly, for another sub-area **Impacts of Domestic Violence on Children**, we may raise the following questions:
    1. What is the impact of DV on the emotional development of child?
    2. How DV affects the child's academic performance?
    3. What are the effects of DV on child physical health?
    4. How DV influence the social behavior of children?

* **Formulate the Objectives**: Now, you should formulate the  objectives your study that you intend to explore. The objectives of the study  basically stem out of the research questions. The difference between research  questions and objective is the way they are written. Research questions are  interrogative sentences. On the other hand, Objectives action or aim-oriented  statements consisting of words *such as to explore, to investigate, to examine, to find out and so on*. The simple way to write your objective is to transform your research question into objective. For instance, we transform the above research questions for **Causes of Domestic Violence** into objectives as follows:
  1. To examine the influence of illiteracy on DV.
  2. To explore the impact of poverty on DV.
  3. To know long-held traditions leading to DV.
  4. To investigate the socio-cultural causes of DV.

  Similarly the research questions for **Impact of Domestic Violence on Children** are transformed into the following objectives:
  1. To understand the impact of DV on the emotional development of a child.
  2. To examine the influence of DV on the child's academic performance.
  3. To know various effects of DV on child's physical health.
  4. To explore the impact of DV on the child's social behavior.

In some research reports,  you may see minor differences in the research questions and the objectives –  you may see that the objectives are not exactly transformed version of the  research questions. This is because, that research question can be a  comprehensive question, *e.g. a composite  of many aspects to be explored about the topic*. On the other hand, the  objective mostly holds a single aspect to be explored about the topic. Hence, the researcher may embed many aspects of the topic in a single research  question to make a composite question. In such a way, the researcher tries to cover all the aspects of inquiry in the given questions. The same researcher may use the objectives only to mention the most intended aspect of inquiry in the research – *as a single aspect in each objective*.


## Formulating your research problem
Formulating your research problem enables you to make a purpose of your study clear to yourself and target readers. Focus your paper on providing relevant data to address it. A problem statement is an effective and essential tool to keep you on track with research and evaluate it. How can you formulate a powerful research problem? Consider 5 ways to formulate the research problem:
* Specify your research objectives;
* Review its context or environment;
* Explore its nature;
* Determine variable relationships;
* Anticipate the possible consequences of alternative approaches.

#### Specific research objectives
A clear statement that defines all objectives can help you conduct and develop effective and meaningful research. They should be manageable to bring you success. A few goals will help you keep your study relevant. This statement also helps professors evaluation the questions your research project answers and different methods that you use to address them.

#### Review the context of your research problem
It’s necessary to work hard to define and test all kinds of environmental variables to make your project successful. Why do you need to do that? This step can help you define if the important findings of your study will deliver enough data to be worth considering. Identify specific environmental variables that may potentially affect your research and start formulating effective methods to control all of them.

#### Why explore the nature of your research problem?
Research problems may range from simple to complex, and everything depends on a range of variables and their relationships. Some of them can be directly relevant to specific research questions, while others are completely unimportant for your project.

**Why should you understand their nature?** This knowledge enables you to develop effective solutions. To get a deep understanding of all dimensions, think about focus groups and other relevant details to provide the necessary insight into a particular question.

#### Determine variable relationships
Scientific, social, and other studies often focus on creating a certain sequence of repeating behaviors over time. What does your project entail? Completing the entire process involves:
* Identifying the variables that affect possible solutions to your research problem;
* Deciding on the degree to which you can use and control all of them for study purposes;
* Determining functional relationships between existing variables;
* Choose the most critical variables for a solution of your research problem.

During the formulation stage, it’s necessary to consider and generate as many potential approaches and variable relationships as you can.

#### What are the consequences of alternative approaches?
There are different consequences that each course of action or approach can bring, and that’s why you need to anticipate them. Why communicate possible outcomes? It’s a primary goal of any research process.

## Structuring your research problem
Look at scientific papers to notice their research questions because they are crucial for determining the quality of answers, methods, and findings. Quantitative designs use deductive reasoning to state a testable hypothesis. Qualitative methods use inductive reasoning to make a strong statement of your future thesis.

#### Tips for defining your research problem
You need to formulate it during the initial stage of a scientific process or study. For instance, literature reviews, research, and studies of previous experiments are likely to provide you with vague areas of interest. Look at the area that brings interesting results. Make sure that it has a potential for exploring. Think about reviewing a successful experiment and try to disagree with its results, methodology, and tests, define the entire process, and retest its hypothesis.

#### The importance of revising
Get useful feedback from teachers, students, and other people to successful revise your research question. A final decision is always up to you. Feel free to decide which advice is helpful. Take the following details into account to simplify this process:
* Agreement among readers that a research problem is very broad;
* Suggestions that you have a certain misunderstanding of the chosen matter;
* Advice for narrowing your subject down or thinking of a better way to focus it;
* Specifics about your misunderstanding;
* A consensus that your research question is very narrow and interesting ideas to make it more general;
* Comments about its clarity and phrasing.

After revising your initial research problem, its possible solutions, and above-mentioned details, you’re ready to write a formal version.

#### Do you have a good research problem?
Do a simple self-test to determine whether it’s good enough for your scientific project and make sure that:
* Your question allows for a number of potential answers;
* It’s testable, flexible, and open-ended;
* You have the evidence necessary to address it;
* It’s possible to break it into resolvable parts;
* It’s precise and clear;
* You don’t use any vague terms that require definitions;
* It’s suitable for the length of your paper;
* You can explain why your solutions matter;
* You made premises explicit.

#### What should a formal version be like?
Any research starts with a problem that you derive from the topic that attracts your attention after general reading, classroom discussions, etc. Most instructors prefer to set general topics. To formulate a powerful research problem and impress them, it should be:
* Interesting;
* Relevant;
* Specific and focused;
* Researchable.

Your question should have enough bearing on a given topic and stay within the limits set by your professors in advance. Pick an interesting subject to stimulate your motivation. It shouldn’t be very vague or broad. If your research question is broad, you can make it more specific by specific aspects, time periods, or events. There shouldn’t be more than a few possible answers.
