Before you start any form of study, get a clear understanding of what a research problem is and learn to formulate it properly. To define a problem correctly, a researcher must know: what a problem is?

## What is a research problem?
A research problem, in general, refers to some difficulty which a researcher experiences in the context of either a theoretical or practical situation and wants to obtain a solution for the same. Usually we say that a research problem does exist if the following conditions are met with:
* There must be an individual (or a group or an organisation), let us call it ‘I,’ to whom the problem can be attributed. The individual or the organisation, as the case may be, occupies an environment, say ‘N’, which is defined by values of the uncontrolled variables, Y<sub>j</sub>.
* There must be at least two courses of action, say C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> , to be pursued. A course of action is defined by one or more values of the controlled variables. For example, the number of items purchased at a specified time is said to be one course of action.
* There must be at least two possible outcomes, say O<sub>1</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> , of the course of action, of which one should be preferable to the other. In other words, this means that there must be at least one outcome that the researcher wants, i.e., an objective.
* The courses of action available must provides some chance of obtaining the objective, but they cannot provide the same chance, otherwise the choice would not matter. Thus, if $$P (O_j \vert I, C_j , N)$$ represents the probability that an outcome O<sub>j</sub> will occur, if I select C<sub>j</sub> in N, then $$P (O_1 \vert I , C_1 , N) ≠ P (O_1 \vert I , C_2 , N)$$. In simple words, we can say that the choices must have unequal efficiencies for the desired outcomes.

viz. **A research problem** is a statement about an area of concern, a condition to be improved, a difficulty to be eliminated, or a troubling question that exists in scholarly literature, in theory, or in practice that points to the need for meaningful understanding and deliberate investigation. In some social science disciplines the research problem is typically posed in the form of a question. A research problem does not state how to do something, offer a vague or broad proposition, or present a value question. However, it is important to remember that not all questions can be transformed into research problems and some may prove to be extremely difficult to study.

We can, thus, state the components of a research problem as under:
* There must be an individual or a group which has some difficulty or the problem.
* There must be some objective(s) to be attained at. If one wants nothing, one cannot have a problem.
* There must be alternative means (or the courses of action) for obtaining the objective(s) one wishes to attain. This means that there must be at least two means available to a researcher for if he has no choice of means, he cannot have a problem.
* There must remain some doubt in the mind of a researcher with regard to the selection of alternatives. This means that research must answer the question concerning the relative efficiency of the possible alternatives.
* There must be some environment(s) to which the difficulty pertains.


Thus, a research problem is one which requires a researcher to find out the best solution for the given problem, i.e., to find out by which course of action the objective can be attained optimally in the context of a given environment. There are several factors which may result in making the problem complicated. For instance, the environment may change affecting the efficiencies of the courses of action or the values of the outcomes; the number of alternative courses of action may be very large; persons not involved in making the decision may be affected by it and react to it favourably or unfavourably, and similar other factors. All such elements (or at least the important ones) may be thought of in context of a research problem.

#### The purpose of a problem statement is to:

* Introduce the reader to the importance of the topic being studied. The reader is oriented to the significance of the study and the research questions or hypotheses to follow.
* Places the problem into a particular context that defines the parameters of what is to be investigated.
* Provides the framework for reporting the results and indicates what is probably necessary to conduct the study and explain how the findings will present this information.


#### How to identify a research problem?
After choosing a specific topic for your academic paper, you need to state it as a clear research problem that identifies all the issues that you’ll address. It’s not always simple for students to formulate it. In some fields, they may end up spending a lot of time thinking, exploring, and studying before getting a clear idea of what research questions to answer. Some topics are too broad to give a researchable issue. For example, if you decide to study certain social issues, like child poverty, remember that they don’t provide any researchable question. These are very broad to address and take a lot of time and resources to become unfeasible so that your study will lack enough focus and depth.

#### What is a statement of a research problem?
An adequate statement of your research problem plays an important role in the success of your academic paper and study. It’s possible to generate a number of researchable issues from the same subject because there are many issues that may arise out of it. Your study should pursue only one in detail.

#### Basic characteristics of research problem
For your research problem to be effective, make sure that it has these basic characteristics:
* Reflecting on important issues or needs
* Basing on factual evidence (it’s non-hypothetical)
* Being manageable and relevant
* Suggesting a testable and meaningful hypothesis (avoiding useless answers)

#### How do we get from the research problem to researchable questions?
Arriving at specific research objectives, questions or hypotheses from an idea or problem is a highly personalised activity - there are different ways of doing it and we all do it differently. Below is one suggestion based around the idea of 'brainstorming'. The results of this process can be displayed in the form of a 'spider diagram' or mental map of ideas and themes related to your research idea. The resulting conceptual map can serve both as a starting point and as a conceptual framework for your investigation.

##### Conceptual frameworks
A common tactic here is to 'unpack' your idea or problem thus generating a range of possibilities before narrowing down on one or two themes. Following the suggestions of Punch (1998) steps could be:
1. write down the all the concepts involved, and all the sub-questions you can think of pertaining to the issue. Reading around your research idea will help to generate questions and information and to identify themes and potential information sources
2. subdivide your questions where possible; split wide general questions into smaller ones
3. begin to order questions and develop focus: group questions together under common themes, separate general and specific questions
4. start to trim by selecting those questions that you wish to deal with, consider the resources that will be available to you
5. collate these thoughts within a loose conceptual framework - this shows how questions and themes are related and may help guide your thinking at a later stage.

This process of thinking wide and then focusing and delimiting your questions, should result in a handful of research questions that you wish to investigate. These may still need further modification to render them answerable; they may need to be operationalised.

Note: there are no right or wrong answers in such an exercise, the purpose is to get you thinking about as many facets of your research idea as possible. It should also cause you to question some of the concepts you might previously have accepted as given.


***Let's take an example of Social Research to understand research problem in more details:***

**Formulation of Social Research Problem** refers to state the problem in a researchable manner. It means to  portray the topic in a way that it  becomes ready for scientific investigation. A research problem is simply  research topic. The researcher needs to refine the topic and clearly state what  is intended to explore about the topic.  Formulation of the research problem basically includes narrowing down the  research area and formulating the objectives. Once the research problem is  formulated, the topic becomes ready to undergo a scientific inquiry *-- the research*.

The formulation of a research problem consists of the following steps:
* **Identify a broad research area of your interest**: A research always starts with  identifying a broad research area depending on his interest, knowledge,  specialty, expertise and profession. Hence, you should first select a major  area which you want to investigate. Such an area must have a wide significance  and must be according to your interest, knowledge  and specialty. For instance, a researcher in social science may select areas  such as poverty reduction, overpopulation,  conflict resolution, crime control, unemployment, political instability,  economic fluctuations, human rights, justice  system, familial issues, cultural practices, social and religious  fragmentations, domestic violence and so on. These are broad areas. Each of  these areas can be split into many research topics.

* **Disect the broad area into sub-areas**: Once you select a broad area,  you need to narrow down the area into a specific topic that is researchable and  manageable for the researcher.  For this,  dissect the broad area into sub-areas to select one specific topic from them.  For instance, you have selected a broad area **Domestic Violence (DV)** for your  research. This broad area can be split into following sub-areas:
  * Profile of families in which DV occurs
  * Profile of victim of DV
  * Profile of <span class="text-primary" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right" title="a person who carries out a harmful, illegal, or immoral act.">perpetrator</span>
  * Causes of DV
  * Types of DV
  * Impact of DV on family
  * Impact of DV on children
  * Services available to the victim of DV
  * Effectiveness of the services provided to the victim of DV
  * Extent of DV in a community

* **Select one of the sub-areas**: It is not feasible for the  researcher to study all the sub-areas due to limited resources -- *time and monetary resources*. Hence, select one the sub-area that interest you more and is more feasible and manageable for you. This area should be relevant to your subject knowledge. It should also have research significance.

* **Raise research questions**: After selecting a specific sub-area, start thinking about  what should you explore about this sub-area (topic). In other words, raise  important questions about the chosen sub-area which need to be answered in your  research. There can be many questions but you have to choose the most important  and relevant ones. Similarly, the number question will determine the length of  your research and thesis. Hence, make a  few questions depending upon the length of your research. For instance, we select one sub-area from the above that is **cause of domestic violence**. We may raise the following questions:
  1. How does illiteracy influence DV?
  2. Is poverty responsible for DV?
  3. How do long-held traditions lead to DV?
  4. What are the socio-cultural causes of DV?

  Similarly, for another sub-area **Impacts of Domestic Violence on Children**, we may raise the following questions:
    1. What is the impact of DV on the emotional development of child?
    2. How DV affects the child's academic performance?
    3. What are the effects of DV on child physical health?
    4. How DV influence the social behavior of children?

* **Formulate the Objectives**: Now, you should formulate the  objectives your study that you intend to explore. The objectives of the study  basically stem out of the research questions. The difference between research  questions and objective is the way they are written. Research questions are  interrogative sentences. On the other hand, Objectives action or aim-oriented  statements consisting of words *such as to explore, to investigate, to examine, to find out and so on*. The simple way to write your objective is to transform your research question into objective. For instance, we transform the above research questions for **Causes of Domestic Violence** into objectives as follows:
  1. To examine the influence of illiteracy on DV.
  2. To explore the impact of poverty on DV.
  3. To know long-held traditions leading to DV.
  4. To investigate the socio-cultural causes of DV.

  Similarly the research questions for **Impact of Domestic Violence on Children** are transformed into the following objectives:
  1. To understand the impact of DV on the emotional development of a child.
  2. To examine the influence of DV on the child's academic performance.
  3. To know various effects of DV on child's physical health.
  4. To explore the impact of DV on the child's social behavior.

In some research reports,  you may see minor differences in the research questions and the objectives –  you may see that the objectives are not exactly transformed version of the  research questions. This is because, that research question can be a  comprehensive question, *e.g. a composite  of many aspects to be explored about the topic*. On the other hand, the  objective mostly holds a single aspect to be explored about the topic. Hence, the researcher may embed many aspects of the topic in a single research  question to make a composite question. In such a way, the researcher tries to cover all the aspects of inquiry in the given questions. The same researcher may use the objectives only to mention the most intended aspect of inquiry in the research – *as a single aspect in each objective*.


## Formulating your research problem
Formulating your research problem enables you to make a purpose of your study clear to yourself and target readers. Focus your paper on providing relevant data to address it. A problem statement is an effective and essential tool to keep you on track with research and evaluate it. How can you formulate a powerful research problem? Consider 5 ways to formulate the research problem:
* Specify your research objectives;
* Review its context or environment;
* Explore its nature;
* Determine variable relationships;
* Anticipate the possible consequences of alternative approaches.

#### Specific research objectives
A clear statement that defines all objectives can help you conduct and develop effective and meaningful research. They should be manageable to bring you success. A few goals will help you keep your study relevant. This statement also helps professors evaluation the questions your research project answers and different methods that you use to address them.

#### Review the context of your research problem
It’s necessary to work hard to define and test all kinds of environmental variables to make your project successful. Why do you need to do that? This step can help you define if the important findings of your study will deliver enough data to be worth considering. Identify specific environmental variables that may potentially affect your research and start formulating effective methods to control all of them.

#### Why explore the nature of your research problem?
Research problems may range from simple to complex, and everything depends on a range of variables and their relationships. Some of them can be directly relevant to specific research questions, while others are completely unimportant for your project.

**Why should you understand their nature?** This knowledge enables you to develop effective solutions. To get a deep understanding of all dimensions, think about focus groups and other relevant details to provide the necessary insight into a particular question.

#### Determine variable relationships
Scientific, social, and other studies often focus on creating a certain sequence of repeating behaviors over time. What does your project entail? Completing the entire process involves:
* Identifying the variables that affect possible solutions to your research problem;
* Deciding on the degree to which you can use and control all of them for study purposes;
* Determining functional relationships between existing variables;
* Choose the most critical variables for a solution of your research problem.

During the formulation stage, it’s necessary to consider and generate as many potential approaches and variable relationships as you can.

#### What are the consequences of alternative approaches?
There are different consequences that each course of action or approach can bring, and that’s why you need to anticipate them. Why communicate possible outcomes? It’s a primary goal of any research process.

## Structuring your research problem
Look at scientific papers to notice their research questions because they are crucial for determining the quality of answers, methods, and findings. Quantitative designs use deductive reasoning to state a testable hypothesis. Qualitative methods use inductive reasoning to make a strong statement of your future thesis.

#### Tips for defining your research problem
You need to formulate it during the initial stage of a scientific process or study. For instance, literature reviews, research, and studies of previous experiments are likely to provide you with vague areas of interest. Look at the area that brings interesting results. Make sure that it has a potential for exploring. Think about reviewing a successful experiment and try to disagree with its results, methodology, and tests, define the entire process, and retest its hypothesis.

#### The importance of revising
Get useful feedback from teachers, students, and other people to successful revise your research question. A final decision is always up to you. Feel free to decide which advice is helpful. Take the following details into account to simplify this process:
* Agreement among readers that a research problem is very broad;
* Suggestions that you have a certain misunderstanding of the chosen matter;
* Advice for narrowing your subject down or thinking of a better way to focus it;
* Specifics about your misunderstanding;
* A consensus that your research question is very narrow and interesting ideas to make it more general;
* Comments about its clarity and phrasing.

After revising your initial research problem, its possible solutions, and above-mentioned details, you’re ready to write a formal version.

#### Do you have a good research problem?
Do a simple self-test to determine whether it’s good enough for your scientific project and make sure that:
* Your question allows for a number of potential answers;
* It’s testable, flexible, and open-ended;
* You have the evidence necessary to address it;
* It’s possible to break it into resolvable parts;
* It’s precise and clear;
* You don’t use any vague terms that require definitions;
* It’s suitable for the length of your paper;
* You can explain why your solutions matter;
* You made premises explicit.

#### What should a formal version be like?
Any research starts with a problem that you derive from the topic that attracts your attention after general reading, classroom discussions, etc. Most instructors prefer to set general topics. To formulate a powerful research problem and impress them, it should be:
* Interesting;
* Relevant;
* Specific and focused;
* Researchable.

Your question should have enough bearing on a given topic and stay within the limits set by your professors in advance. Pick an interesting subject to stimulate your motivation. It shouldn’t be very vague or broad. If your research question is broad, you can make it more specific by specific aspects, time periods, or events. There shouldn’t be more than a few possible answers.

## Selecting the problem
The research problem undertaken for study must be carefully selected. The task is a difficult one, although it may not appear to be so. Help may be taken from a research guide in this connection. Nevertheless, every researcher must find out his own salvation for research problems cannot be borrowed. A problem must spring from the researcher’s mind like a plant springing from its own seed. If our eyes need glasses, it is not the optician alone who decides about the number of the lens we require. We have to see ourselves and enable him to prescribe for us the right number by cooperating with him. Thus, a research guide can at the most only help a researcher choose a subject. However, the following points may be observed by a researcher in selecting a research problem or a subject for research:
* Subject which is overdone should not be normally chosen, for it will be a difficult task to throw any new light in such a case.

* Controversial subject should not become the choice of an average researcher.

* Too narrow or too vague problems should be avoided.

* The subject selected for research should be familiar and feasible so that the related research material or sources of research are within one’s reach. Even then it is quite difficult to supply definitive ideas concerning how a researcher should obtain ideas for his research. For this purpose, a researcher should contact an expert or a professor in the University who is already engaged in research. He may as well read articles published in current literature available on the subject and may think how the techniques and ideas discussed therein might be applied to the solution of other problems. He may discuss with others what he has in mind concerning a problem. In this way he should make all possible efforts in selecting a problem.

* The importance of the subject, the qualifications and the training of a researcher, the costs involved, the time factor are few other criteria that must also be considered in selecting a problem. In other words, before the final selection of a problem is done, a researcher must ask himself the following questions:
  1. Whether he is well equipped in terms of his background to carry out the research?
  2. Whether the study falls within the budget he can afford?
  3. Whether the necessary cooperation can be obtained from those who must participate in research as subjects?

  If the answers to all these questions are in the affirmative, one may become sure so far as the practicability of the study is concerned.

* The selection of a problem must be preceded by a preliminary study. This may not be necessary when the problem requires the conduct of a research closely similar to one that has already been done. But when the field of inquiry is relatively new and does not have available a set of well developed techniques, a brief feasibility study must always be undertaken.

## Technique involved in Defining a Problem
Defining a problem involves the task of laying down boundaries within which a researcher shall study the problem with a pre-determined objective in view. Defining a research problem properly and clearly is a crucial part of a research study and must in no case be accomplished hurriedly. The technique for the purpose involves the undertaking of the following steps generally one after the other:
* statement of the problem in a general way;
* understanding the nature of the problem;
* surveying the available literature
* developing the ideas through discussions; and
* rephrasing the research problem into a working proposition.

A brief description of all these points is as follows:

1. **Statement of the problem in a general way**: First  of  all  the problem  should  be  stated  in  abroad general way, keeping in view either some practical concern or some scientific or intellectual interest. In case of social research, it is considered advisable to do some field observation and as such the researcher may undertake some sort of preliminary survey or what is often called pilot survey. The problem stated in a broad general way may contain various ambiguities which must be resolved by cool thinking and rethinking over the problem. At the same time the feasibility of a particular solution has to be considered and the same should be kept in view while stating the problem

2. **Understanding the nature of the problem**: The  next  step  in  defining  the  problem  is  to understand its origin and nature clearly. The researcher should also keep in view the environment within which the problem is to be studied and understood.

3. **Surveying the available literature**: All available literature concerning the problem at hand must necessarily be surveyed and examined before a definition of the research problem is given.This means that the researcher must be well-conversant with relevant theories in the field, reports and  records  as  also  all  other  relevant  literature. This would also help a researcher to know if there are certain gaps in the theories, or whether the existing theories applicable to the problem under study are inconsistent with each other, or whether the findings of the different studies do not follow a pattern consistent with the theoretical expectations and so on. Studies on related problems are useful for indicating the type  of  difficulties  that  may  be  encountered  in  the  present  study  as  also  the  possible  analytical shortcomings. At times such studies may also suggest useful and even new lines of approach to the present problem.

4. **Developing the ideas through discussions**: A researcher must discuss his problem with his colleagues and others who have enough experience in the same area or in working on similar problems. This is quite often known as an experience survey.

5. **Rephrasing the research problem**: Through rephrasing, the researcher puts the research problem in as specific terms as possible so that it may become operationally viable and may help in the development of working hypotheses. In addition to what has been stated above, the following points must also be observed while defining a research problem:
  * Technical terms and words or phrases, with special meanings used in the statement of the problem, should be clearly defined.
  * Basic assumptions or postulates (if any) relating to the research problem should be clearly stated.
  * A  straight  forward  statement  of  the  value  of  the  investigation  (i.e.,  the  criteria  for  the selection of the problem) should be provided.
  * The suitability of the time-period and the sources of data available must also be considered by the researcher in defining the problem.
  * The scope of the investigation or the limits within which the problem is to be studied must be mentioned explicitly in defining a research problem.

## Importance of Literature Review in Defining a Problem
A **literature review** is a comprehensive summary of the ideas, issues, approaches and research findings that have been published on a particular subject area or topic. However, it is not a simple description of all that the reviewer has read on the topic. It is better understood as a critical synthesis (or bringing together) of:
* what can reasonably be asserted based on the extent of the literature findings
* what worked and didn’t work in terms of methods of (and approaches to)
investigation
* what can be gleaned from the range of theoretical perspectives that have been applied
* what gaps, inconsistencies or problems still need to be addressed in further research on the topic
* what results may reasonably be expected to be repeatable, and under what
circumstances.

When you are preparing your own literature reviews, you will need to think about critically evaluating the research that you read. Of course, being ‘critical’ doesn’t have to mean being ‘negative’ – you can also ‘critically’ examine the strengths and positive aspects of a piece of research.

***Why is the literature review so important?*** Synthesising evidence helps us to find out what we know and don’t know about what works and what doesn’t work. A good research synthesis can generally give us the most reliable estimate of the effectiveness of a specific intervention, and it can identify gaps in our knowledge that require further research. It can also give us a sense of the strength of the available evidence and the quality of the studies, thereby indicating how much confidence practitioners, service users, managers, policymakers, and the popular media should have in the results. A research synthesis can also help us find out how well a policy, programme, technique or intervention works in different subgroups of users and inform us about its potential to cause harm. Some research syntheses can shed light on the pros and cons of different ways of organising or delivering services or policies. A research synthesis that includes considerations of cost can help shape our judgements about whether a chosen policy or course of action provides good value for money.

***Where does the literature review fit within the context of research?*** The near ubiquitous presence of the literature review in so many disciplines and areas of policy development must not be allowed to mask the fact that there are essentially three contexts in which a literature review will be showcased:
1. As a component, or even entire ingredient, of a dissertation, thesis or other academic deliverable.
2. As a peer-reviewed publication, typically in a journal or, depending upon the discipline, as a book chapter.
3. As a report resulting from a funded research project or other commissioned research or consultancy.

Reviews for knowledge support have as their endpoint the summarising and synthesis of research evidence (i.e. what currently exists and is known about a topic). They may usefully highlight gaps in the evidence base as a target for future research; seen in closest proximity within a thesis which may have the specific subsequent objective of addressing such a gap. Reviews for decision support seek to go further in bringing the existing evidence to bear on the particular individualised problem in hand. Gaps in the evidence base in this context lead to the supplementary question ‘... and what are we going to do about this issue or problem in the meantime?’ Such questions are well-typified in a survey by Lavis and colleagues (2005) who found that managers were interested in reviews that addressed:
* decisions about continuing, starting/expanding, stopping/contracting or modifying a programme;
* how to Àt programmes or services within an organisation or region  i.e. about governance, Ànancial and delivery arrangements;
* how to bring about change.

***What types of research question are suitable for literature review?***
* Effectiveness questions: What effect does intervention X, compared with intervention y, have on outcome Z? What are the relative cost-benefits of x versus y?
* Methodology questions: What research methods have previously been used to investigate phenomenon X? What are the respective strengths and weaknesses of such methods?
* Conceptual questions: How has phenomenon X been identified and defined? Which theories have been used to explain phenomenon X? Which theory provides the best fit to findings from empirical studies? What are the main unresolved controversies? What are the underpinning epistemological and ontological foundations for the discipline?


#### Types of Literature Review
The two main types of literature review you are likely to come across are:
* narrative literature reviews
* systematic literature reviews.

**Narrative literature reviews**: These are sometimes referred to as traditional literature reviews and are likely to be the most common type of literature review that you come across. They are characterised by a concern for drawing together conceptual and theoretical ideas from a range of literature. However, they can vary widely in terms of how explicit the reviewer is about how they:
* carried out the review process
* carried out their search strategy
* decided on what to include and exclude from their review
* decided on what to foreground in their synthesis of material.

In this sense, they are often viewed as being less rigorous than systematic reviews, but for students and novice literature review writers they are likely to represent the first stage of your literature review journey. They can also offer a greater degree of flexibility and the facility to adapt and change as the literature review progresses.

**Systematic literature reviews**:
Systematic literature reviews are generally much more rigorous and systematic in terms of:
* how the review process is carried out
* how material is assessed or appraised
* how findings are reported.

They have effectively come to be seen as the ‘gold standard’ in respect of literature reviews. The focus of systematic reviews is usually very well defined and relates to practice-based contexts and issues. They aim to address as much of the published literature as possible in order to develop a comprehensive coverage of the topic under investigation.
Systematic reviews require a high level of transparency relating to issues such as:

how the research question was identified
* how the topic area was defined
* what data sources (e.g. particular databases) were used for searching
* the search terms and keywords used, and whether the search strategy was
adapted or modified
* the extent of the literature identified through the search process
* the selection criteria used to decide which literature to include and exclude from the final study
* the method of the data extraction process (e.g. how data was taken from individual studies)
* the problems and challenges involved in synthesising findings/results from a number of different studies
* how consistency was maintained (this is particularly important in cases where reviews are carried out by teams).

#### Methods Used in Literature Reviewing
Literature reviewing involves a number of different activities and processes, which become significant at different stages of the review process. The organisation of the chapters of this book broadly reflects the order in which you would normally carry out these activities and processes. Each activity will require the reviewer to make decisions about what particular methods to use.

* **Search methods**: Searching for literature can involve multiple methods, such as:
  * manual searching – searching by hand using paper-based journals
  * electronic database searching – making use of multiple ways of searching fields
and records
  * keyword searches – experimenting with different combinations of words
  * boolean operators – using special Boolean terms to alter the scope of the search
  * developing, applying and revising exclusion and inclusion criteria.

  It’s likely that you will have come across many of these methods before in relation to literature searching that you will have done for other academic assignments. However, learning to be more structured and organised in the way that you carry out searches can take some practice.

* **Data extraction methods**: The purpose of data extraction is ‘to extract the findings from each study in a consistent manner to enable later synthesis, and to extract information to enable quality appraisal so that the findings can be interpreted’ (Rutter et al., 2010: 47). In other words, the data extraction process allows the reviewer to:
  * pull out relevant findings and data from each of the selected studies
  * compare, contrast and pull together findings where appropriate.

  To do this, the literature reviewer must first identify what kinds of data are of interest, and then devise a consistent approach to identifying and extracting this data from the literature under review. This data may be either quantitative or qualitative, or a mixture of both.

  For systematic literature reviews, it is common to use a special ‘data extraction form’, which aims to ensure that a consistent, objective and unbiased approach is taken. For the same reasons, the data extraction process may be undertaken by two or more reviewers. The SCIE Systematic Research Reviews: Guidelines (Rutter et al., 2010: 91–4) includes a sample data extraction form which outlines the kinds of information that may need to be recorded, including:
  1. Publication details (e.g. author name, year of publication, title, etc.)
  2. Details about the nature of the study (e.g. aims, questions addressed, site of research, target population, theories/models used, etc.)
  3. Details about the nature of practice interventions (e.g. type and aim of intervention, practice setting, rationale, implementation issues, etc.)
  4. Outcomes and results (e.g. how outcomes are measured, what the outcomes were, what the strengths/limitations of the study were).

* **Critical appraisal methods**: In appraising the literature you are aiming to:
  * form a judgement about whether a particular publication is relevant to the topic of your literature review
  * assess whether you think that the findings and implications are reliable and valid.

  The focus of the critical appraisal is on the way in which the research has been carried out, as opposed to the effectiveness of any intervention reported on. Literature reviewers will often develop or adopt critical appraisal tools to assist them in carrying out a thorough and consistent appraisal process.

  For your own literature review processes you will need to spend some time considering what kind of appraisal criteria are most appropriate to your review. Rutter et al. (2010) have identified some general issues that they would expect to be addressed in a systematic review appraisal tool for empirical studies. These include the following:
  * Has the research been designed in such a way that can appropriately address the question?
  * Did services users and carers have input into the design of the study?
