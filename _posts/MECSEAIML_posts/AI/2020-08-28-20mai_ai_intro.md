## What is AI?
AI is about algorithms enabled by constraints, exposed by representations that support models targeted at loops that tie thinking, perception, and action together. In other words, AI is the simulation of human intelligence process by machines, especially computer systems. AI is sometimes called Machine Intelligence.

## Philosophy of AI
While exploiting the power of the computer systems, the curiosity of human, lead him to wonder, *Can a machine think and behave like humans do?* Thus, the development of AI started with the intention of creating similar intelligence in machines that we find and regard high in humans.

## Two types of Intelligence
* Cognitive: Based on our imagination and persuasion
  * AI cannot compete with cognitive.
* Routine: Where the solution is already known
  * AI replicates the pattern recognition process of our brain

## Weak AI and Strong AI
Weak AI presents AI as a tool for solving problems, whereas Strong AI is the generation of an “actual” mind.

According to weak AI, the principal value of the computer in the study of the mind is that it gives us a very powerful tool. For example, it enables us to formulate and test hypotheses in a more rigorous and precise fashion. But according to strong AI, the computer is not merely a tool in the study of the mind: rather, the appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states. In strong AI, because the programmed computer has cognitive states, the programs are not mere tools that enable us to test psychological explanations; rather, the programs are themselves the explanations (Searle, 1980,p. 417).

For Searle, Weak AI is the attempt at modelling the human mind in a similar way to modelling weather conditions, climate change, or other natural phenomena. By extension, weak AI does not aim to reproduce, or produce a mind any more than a computer model of an ongoing storm seeks to reproduce an actual storm.
Strong AI, on the other hand, seeks to actually produce a mind, or an intelligence which literally possesses and understands other mental states.
Moreover, we may also treat Weak AI as operating purely in the realm of functional consciousness, while Strong AI operates in the realm of phenomenal consciousness and thus can be said to possess a mind.

#### Weak AI
This categorization is rooted in the difference between the supervised and unsupervised programming as voice-activated assistance usually has a programmed response. What they do is a sense or ‘scan’ for things that are similar to what they already know, and classify them accordingly. This is a human-like feature, but that’s basically where the similarities end as weak AIs are simply simulations. If you ask Siri to turn on the air conditioner, it understands keywords such as “on” and “air conditioner,” so it will respond by turning on the air conditioner. However, it is only responding to what it is programmed to do. It does not understand or derive meaning from what you said.

#### Strong AI
Featured in a lot of movies, strong AI functions more like the human brain. They don’t classify, and they use clustering and association to process data. This means there isn’t a programmed answer to your keywords or requests, as can be seen in weak AIs, and the results of their programming and functions are largely unpredictable. For example, when you are talking to a human, you can only assume what someone’s response will be. A popular example of strong AI is the one found in games. It is more independent than weak AI and can learn and adapt to different situations. Another example of strong AI is poker AI which can teach itself to adapt to and outsmart the skills of human opponents.

Although weak AI is the more common version, strong AI has also been a crucial part of the AI revolution. It is often described by scientists as the ‘true representation of human intelligence in machines.’


Below table shows the comparison of Weak AI and Strong AI:

## History of AI
<img src="/assets/20MAI/AI/ai_history.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="Scientific Method image" style="max-width: 97%; max-height: 50rem;">

Modern AI began in the 1950s with the view to solving complex mathematical problems and creating 'thinking machines'. From the outset, there were two competing approaches. One used formal rules to manipulate symbols, a logic-based approach not at all based on biology. This became known as ‘**good old-fashioned artificial intelligence**’: GOFAI. The other camp took inspiration from how the brain works and created ‘artificial neural networks’ loosely inspired by our brains. These still had to be trained using certain procedures to solve problems.

In the first 20 years, GOFAI was the more successful approach, leading to much hype and significant government funding. But in real-world settings GOFAI didn't achieve its outcomes. Artificial neural networks also struggled, and in the 1970s funding dried up, research slowed and the AI community shrank. In the 1980s, improvements were made in both the rules-based GOFAI systems and biologically-inspired neural networks. Previously difficult problems became achievable and AI seemed promising once again. However, the hope and hype exceeded reality, and by the 1990s AI research again diminished.

The latest surge of interest comes off the back of the power of deep learning, a type of biologically-inspired neural network that harnesses the huge amounts of data now available, and the massive computational power and speed of today’s computers.

With enormous data sets, modern AI neural networks can often exceed human performance in many tasks, including pattern recognition and playing games like Go, previously very difficult for AI. Importantly, these systems can learn from experience, unlike GOFAI.

AI's ubiquity might now appear like it's not far off reaching human-level intelligence. But AI needs massive amounts of data to learn, unlike our brains, which can learn from a single experience.

Some researchers argue that for AI to advance further, more needs to be understood about the basic principles of how our brains function, and the kinds of biological shortcuts our brains take to complete tasks.  

## Goals of AI
The goals of AI falls under a quartet of types placed along two dimensions. One dimension is whether the goal is to match human performance, or, instead, ideal rationality. The other dimension is wheter the goal is to build systems that reason/think, or rather systems that act. The situation is summed up in the table:

## What Contributes to AI?
Artificial intelligence is a science and technology based on disciplines such as Computer Science, Biology, Psychology, Linguistics, Mathematics, and Engineering. A major thrust of AI is in the development of computer functions associated with human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, and problem solving. Out of the following areas, one or multiple areas can contribute to build an intelligent system.
* Computer Science
* Philosophy
* Psychology
* Sociology
* Mathematics
* Biology
* Neuroscience

## Programming Without and With AI
The programming without and with AI is different in following ways:

## What is AI Technique?
In the real world, the knowledge has some unwelcome properties such as huge volume, unorganized, and constantly changing. AI Technique is a manner to organize and use the knowledge efficiently in such a way that −
* It should be perceivable by the people who provide it.
* It should be easily modifiable to correct errors.
* It should be useful in many situations though it is incomplete or inaccurate.
* AI techniques elevate the speed of execution of the complex program it is equipped with.

## Turing Test
The Turing test, originally called the imitation game by Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. Turing Test was introduced by Turing in his 1950 paper, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," which considered the question, "Can Machine think?"

The Turing test is based on a party game "Imitation game", with some modifications. This game involves three players in which one player is Computer, another player is human responder, and the third player is a human Interrogator, who is isolated from other two players and his job is to find that which player is machine among two of them.

Consider, Player A is a computer, Player B is human, and Player C is an interrogator. Interrogator is aware that one of them is machine, but he needs to identify this on the basis of questions and their responses.

The conversation between all players is via keyboard and screen so the result would not depend on the machine's ability to convert words as speech.

The test result does not depend on each correct answer, but only how closely its responses like a human answer. The computer is permitted to do everything possible to force a wrong identification by the interrogator.

The questions and answers can be like:

**Interrogator**: Are you a computer?

**PlayerA (Computer)**: No

**Interrogator**: Multiply two large numbers such as (256896489*456725896)

**Player A**: Long pause and give the wrong answer.

In this game, if an interrogator would not be able to identify which is a machine and which is human, then the computer passes the test successfully, and the machine is said to be intelligent and can think like a human.

"In 1991, the New York businessman Hugh Loebner announces the prize competition, offering a $100,000 prize for the first computer to pass the Turing test. However, no AI program to till date, come close to passing an undiluted Turing test".

##### Chatbots to attempt the Turing test:
**ELIZA**: ELIZA was a Natural language processing computer program created by Joseph Weizenbaum. It was created to demonstrate the ability of communication between machine and humans. It was one of the first chatterbots, which has attempted the Turing Test.

**Parry**: Parry was a chatterbot created by Kenneth Colby in 1972. Parry was designed to simulate a person with Paranoid schizophrenia(most common chronic mental disorder). Parry was described as "ELIZA with attitude." Parry was tested using a variation of the Turing Test in the early 1970s.

**Eugene Goostman**: Eugene Goostman was a chatbot developed in Saint Petersburg in 2001. This bot has competed in the various number of Turing Test. In June 2012, at an event, Goostman won the competition promoted as largest-ever Turing test content, in which it has convinced 29% of judges that it was a human.Goostman resembled as a 13-year old virtual boy.

##### Features required for a machine to pass the Turing test:
* Natural language processing: NLP is required to communicate with Interrogator in general human language like English.
* Knowledge representation: To store and retrieve information during the test.
* Automated reasoning: To use the previously stored information for answering the questions.
* Machine learning: To adapt new changes and can detect generalized patterns.
* Vision (For total Turing test): To recognize the interrogator actions and other objects during a test.
* Motor Control (For total Turing test): To act upon objects if requested.


## AI Applications
There are numerous AI applications in the modern age of big data. Some of the main applications of AI are as follows

##### AI in Medical and Healthcare
The complexity and rise of data in healthcare means that artificial intelligence (AI) will increasingly be applied within the field. Several types of AI are already being employed by payers and providers of care, and life sciences companies. The key categories of applications involve diagnosis and treatment recommendations, patient engagement and adherence, and administrative activities.

There are already a number of research studies suggesting that AI can perform as well as or better than humans at key healthcare tasks, such as diagnosing disease. Today, algorithms are already outperforming radiologists at spotting malignant tumors, and guiding researchers in how to construct cohorts for costly clinical trials.

**Diagnosis and treatment** of disease has been a focus of AI since at least the 1970s, when MYCIN was developed at Stanford for diagnosing blood-borne bacterial infections. More recently, IBM's Watson has received considerable attention in the media for its focus on precision medicine, particularly cancer diagnosis and treatment. There are also several firms that focus specifically on diagnosis and treatment recommendations for certain cancers based on their genetic profiles. Since many cancers have a genetic basis, human clinicians have found it increasingly complex to understand all genetic variants of cancer and their response to new drugs and protocols.

**Patient engagement and adherence** has long been seen as the ‘last mile’ problem of healthcare – the final barrier between ineffective and good health outcomes. The more patients proactively participate in their own well-being and care, the better the outcomes – utilisation, financial outcomes and member experience. These factors are increasingly being addressed by big data and AI. Another growing focus in healthcare is on effectively designing the ‘choice architecture’ to nudge patient behaviour in a more anticipatory way based on real world evidence. Through information provided by provider EHR systems, biosensors, watches, smartphones, conversational interfaces and other instrumentation, software can tailor recommendations by comparing patient data to other effective treatment pathways for similar cohorts. The recommendations can be provided to providers, patients, nurses, call-centre agents or care delivery coordinators.

There are also a great many **administrative applications** in healthcare. The use of AI is somewhat less potentially revolutionary in this domain as compared to patient care, but it can provide substantial efficiencies. These are needed in healthcare because, for example, the average US nurse spends 25% of work time on regulatory and administrative activities. The technology that is most likely to be relevant to this objective is RPA. It can be used for a variety of applications in healthcare, including claims processing, clinical documentation, revenue cycle management and medical records management. Some healthcare organisations have also experimented with chatbots for patient interaction, mental health and wellness, and telehealth. These NLP-based applications may be useful for simple transactions like refilling prescriptions or making appointments.

##### AI in transportation and services
Transportation problems become a challenge when the system and users’ behaviour is too difﬁcult to model and predict the travel patterns. Therefore, AI is deemed to be a good ﬁt for transportation systems to overcome the challenges of an increasing travel demand, CO2 emissions, safety concerns, and environmental degradation. These challenges arise from the steady growth of rural and urban trafﬁc due to the increasing number of population, especially in the developing countries. In Australia, the cost of congestion is expected to reach 53.3 billion as the population increase to 30 million by 2031.

AI has already begun to dramatically change the world economy and will likely continue to do so. AI advances could add some $13 trillion to global economic output by 2030, according to analysts. This includes the transport sector, where AI is expected to drive additional disruption. In 2017, the global market for transportation-related AI technologies reached $1.2 to $1.4 billion, according to estimates from global research firms.

The AI applications in transport have been developing and implementing in a variety of ways. Some of those are discussed below

**Urban mobility**: Small-scale autonomous bus trials have been implemented around the world, in places as diverse as Finland, Singapore, and China. Autonomous shuttles are already operational in Norway, Sweden, and France.

**Traffic management operations**: Many AI algorithms are well-suited to solving complex problems such as those posed by traffic operation, and they are being used around the world. One example is SurTrac from Rapid Flow Technologies, a Carnegie Mellon University spinoff, which provides solutions for intelligent traffic signal controls.

**Logistics**: Trucking is a key target for AI interventions, with cargo delivery as a potential early space for adoption of AV technology across the world.

**Railways**: GE transportation has developed intelligent technologies to improve the efficiency of their locomotives. The smart-freight locomotives are equipped with sensors that collect data and feed it into a machine-learning application.

**Marine**: Autonomous ships are one obvious application of AI in the shipping sector. Shipping companies like Nippon Yusen and Rolls-Royce’s marine operation (now Kongsberg) are testing their prototypes, the latter of which successfully tested an autonomous ship in Finland in 2018.

**Aviation**: Many companies have been looking into using drones for cargo delivery. For example, Nautilus, a California-based start-up is developing a cargo drone with a 90-ton capacity.

**Trucking**: China Post and Deppon Express, two Chinese logistics companies, are using intelligent driving technology from Fabu to deploy autonomous trucks on Chinese roads this year.

**Aviation**: There are opportunities for AI technologies in drones, with many applications for deliveries of all sizes and types. In places without established infrastructure such as parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, drones are being used in healthcare.

**Logistics**: Established logistics players can also harness the benefits of AI in their operations. Logiety, a Mexican company, is using machine learning to streamline the international customs and taxing process by classifying and sorting products for import and export by material, size, and weight, as well as matching them with their corresponding tariffs.

**Incident Detection**: Many attempts were established to identify, the time, location and the severity of an incident to support trafﬁc managers to mitigate congestion. These attempts are ranging from manual reports to automated algorithms to Neural Networks. Manual reports that are written by humans can have a delay in detecting incidents and cost-effective.

#### AI in Business
Robotic process automation is being applied to highly repetitive tasks normally performed by humans. Machine learning algorithms are being integrated into analytics and CRM (Customer relationship management) platforms to uncover information on how to better serve customers. Chatbots have already been incorporated into websites and e companies to provide immediate service to customers. Automation of job positions has also become a talking point among academics and IT consultancies. The adoption of AI technology in the organizations has also led to the shaping of business contexts (factors which influence the performance of the business).

**Customer interaction** is the most basic form of communication between a company and its customers. Every single interaction is another opportunity for the company to satisfy customers and retain them. In the conventional process, customers used to interact with the employees of the company, holding the position of retail shop executive, salespersons, cashiers, customer relationship managers etc. for all their needs, products and services. The integration of intelligent agents in the companies is transforming the customer interaction from ‘human-to-human’ to ‘human-to-machine’. “Chatbots” and “virtual assistants” are the intelligent conversational agents capable of conducting a human-like conversation with the customers via textual and auditory method respectively. These agents are eliminating delays, human errors and provide almost immediate personalized responses to the customers. A few exemplary companies with the successful implementation of chatbots are:
1. Google duplex: For making real world calls
2. 1-800-Flowers: Order flowers
3. North face: Product selection
4. Spotify: Discover weekly playlist
5. KFC: Facial recognition for order prediction

**The Sales Platform**: The advancement in technology has introduced and encouraged the concept of electronic commerce business models (E-commerce). A number of business organizations have switched from the traditional method to the electronic method to sell their products and services. Automation and AI is strengthening this business model by providing a better buy- sell experience to both buyers and sellers via sales prediction, recommendation engines, warehouse automation, and innovative e-commerce platforms. Amazon, Netflix, Alibaba, and eBay are the brand names for online retailing which have significantly transformed the market through above AI processes. These vendors guide the customers towards the purchase of a product by various means viz. personalized digital advertisements on the web, customized coupons/ offer suggestions, and distinctive emails/ messages. All these tasks make use of past behavior of a customer (as previous purchases, selections or ratings), current search keywords, and many other parameters to recommend different products.

#### AI in education
The application of AI in education (AIEd) has been the subject of research for about 30 years. The International AIEd Society (IAIED) was launched in 1997, and publishes the International Journal of AI in Education (IJAIED), with the 20th annual AIEd conference being organised this year.

Following are the areas of AI in higher education:
* Profiling and Prediction
  * Admission decisions and course scheduling
  * Drop-out and retention
  * Student models and academic achievement

* Intelligent Tutoring Systems
  * Teaching course content
  * Diagnosing strengths or gaps in student knowledge, and providing automated feedback
  * Curating learning materials based on student needs
  * Facilitating collaboration between learners
  * The teachers’ perspective

* Assessment and Evaluation
  * Automated grading
  * Feedback
  * Evaluation of student understanding, engagement, and academic integrity
  * Evaluation of teaching
  * Adaptive systems and personalisation
  * Teaching course content
  * Recommending/providing personalised content
  * Supporting teachers in learning and teaching design
  * Using academic data to monitor and guide students
  * Supporting representation of knowledge in concept maps

There now exists ICAI (Intelligent Computer-Assisted Instruction) systems to teach or tutor many different subjects. The teaching strategies most commonly employed in ICAI systems are:
1. coaching the student within a particular activity, such as a game-playing situation; the intent is to manipulate the environment and the coaching such that a particular skill(s) or general problem-solving ability is acquired;
2. questioning the student to encourage reasoning about current knowledge and to modify or formulate concepts; this may involve simulations or games in which the student can discover facts or laws;
3. providing tasks for the student and evaluating the responses in order to detect the student’s misconceptions.

Example of ICAI systems: SOPHIE (SOPHisticated Instructional Environment) is an ICAI system for electronic troubleshooting. Rather than instructing the user on the subject of electronics, SOPHIE provides the student with a learning environment in which to acquire problem-solving skills by trying out ideas. SOPHIE is a computer-based expert that helps the student to develop, test, and debug appropriate hypotheses.

* **Learning environments for student-initiated learning**: Unlike most CA1 systems, which are interactive computer programs, LOGO is a program- ming environment. The child is the programmer; he/she manipulates the equipment, controls and builds the programming environment. In other words, LOGO is an attempt to provide an appropriate, friendly environment in which student-initiated learning (SIL) can take place.

* **Expert systems for educational diagnosis**: The system would not necessarily test the student directly, nor would it manage the testing activities. Rather it would guide the diagnostician. Interaction is between the computer and the diagnostician, with the system posing questions or making appropriate suggestions. Interaction between the computer and the child could also be incorporated. In fact, administration and scoring of some standardized tests has been computerized. Of course, computerized testing need not be restricted to standardized tests.

#### AI in Autonomous vehicles
AI in Autonomous vehicles: Just like humans, self-driving cars need to have sensors to understand the world around them and a brain to collect, processes and choose specific actions based on information gathered. Autonomous vehicles are equipped with advanced tool to gather information, including long range radar, cameras, and LIDAR. Each of the technologies are used in different capacities and each collects different information. This information is useless, unless it is processed and some form of information is taken based on the gathered information. This is where artificial intelligence comes into play and can be compared to human brain. AI has several applications for these vehicles and among them the more immediate ones are as follows:
* Directing the car to gas station or recharge station when it is running low on fuel.
* Adjust the trips directions based on known traffic conditions to find the quickest route.
* Incorporate speech recognition for advanced communication with passengers.
* Natural language interfaces and virtual assistance technologies.

The first use of AI for autonomous driving goes back to the second Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Autonomous Vehicle Challenge in 2005, which was won by the Stanford University Racing Team's autonomous robotic car 'Stanley'. The winning team, led by Sebastian Thurn, an associate professor of computer science and director of Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, attributed the victory to use of machine learning. Stanley was equipped with multiple sensors and backed by custom-written software, including machine learning algorithms, which helped the vehicle find the path, detect obstacles and avoid them while staying on the course. Thurn later led the 'Self-Driving Car Project' at Google, which eventually became Waymo in 2016.

Another AI applications in vehicles are:
* Sensor Data Processing
* Path Planning
* Path Execution
* Monitoring Vehicle’s Condition
* Insurance Data Collection

#### AI for robotics
Nowadays, robots are becoming ‘smarter’ and more efficient with the help of computer science. So, Artificial Intelligence has played a very major role not only in increasing the comforts of humans but also by increasing industrial productivity which includes the quantitative as well as qualitative production and cost-efficiency. AI for robotics will allow us to address the challenges in taking care of an aging population and allow much longer independence. It will drastically reduce, may be even bring down traffic accidents and deaths, as well as enable disaster response for dangerous situations for example the nuclear meltdown at the fukushima power plant.

In today’s global manufacturing sector, there are a few main ways in which AI is deployed.
* **Assembly**: AI is a highly useful tool in robotic assembly applications. When combined with advanced vision systems, AI can help with real-time course correction, which is particularly useful in complex manufacturing sectors like aerospace. AI can also be used to help a robot learn on its own which paths are best for certain processes while it’s in operation.
* **Packaging**: Robotic packaging uses forms of AI frequently for quicker, lower cost and more accurate packaging. AI helps save certain motions a robotic system makes, while constantly refining them, which makes installing and moving robotic systems easy enough for anybody to do.
* **Customer Service**: Robots are now being used in a customer service capacity in retail stores and hotels around the world. Most of these robots leverage AI natural language processing abilities to interact with customers in a more human way. Often, the more these systems can interact with humans, the more they learn.
* **Open Source Robotics**: A handful of robotic systems are now being sold as open source systems with AI capability. This way, users can teach their robots to do custom tasks based on their specific application, such as small-scale agriculture. The convergence of open source robotics and AI could be a huge trend in the future of AI robots.

#### Cyborg Technology
Cyborg Technology: One of the main limitations of being human is simply our own bodies and brains. Researcher Shimon Whiteson thinks that in the future, we will be able to augment ourselves with computers and enhance many of our own natural abilities. Though many of these possible cyborg enhancements would be added for convenience, others may serve a more practical purpose. Yoky Matsuka of Nest believes that AI will become useful for people with amputated limbs, as the brain will be able to communicate with a robotic limb to give the patient more control. This kind of cyborg technology would significantly reduce the limitations that amputees deal with daily. In the future, predictive analytics and artificial intelligence could play an even more fundamental role in content creation and also in the software fields. Open-source information and artificial intelligence collection will provide opportunities for global technological parity and the technology of artificial can become the future in all the domains of health, environment, public safety, and security.

One of the primary and utilitarian goals of artificial intelligence research is to develop machines with human-like intelligence. Great progress has been made since the start of AI as a field of study. One dominating research paradigm in AI has been based on the assumption that various aspects of human intelligence can be described and understood well enough to the extent that it can be simulated by computer programs through smart representational frameworks and generic reasoning mechanisms. Now a day’s fusion take place Biological beings and computer systems share some common physical foundations. Communication in both biological nervous systems and computer systems, for example, depends on electrical signals. Yet, the gap between these two classes of vastly different systems is obvious and bridge with “Cyborg Intelligence”. Cyborg is another possibility in Medical Robotics domains. Cyborg “Cybernetic organism” is a being with both organic and Biomechatronic body parts using which human can increase their power in all means and branch of study is “Cyborgology”.

Recent cyborg intelligence research areas have included the following topics:
* Animals as sensors—utilization of animals as sensors; for example, dog's olfactory sense.
* Animals as actuators—using animals as actuators to complete certain actions.
* Mind-controlled machines—decoding the human mind to control external devices.
* Neurochips—chips designed to connect to neuronal cells; for example, memory chips to replace memory cortex for memory restoration and enhancement.
* Intelligent prosthesis—devices replacing a missing or damaged body part using the human nerve system and brain interfacing to increase precision and achieve comfort of movements.
* Neuromorphics—analog, digital, and mixed-mode analog/digital VLSIs and software systems that implement models of neural systems (such as perception, motor control, and multisensory integration).
* Symbiotic cognition—integration of biological cognitive functions with computational models of cognition.
