Do you wonder like me how these Artificial Neural Networks works but never really dig deeper? Well, I'm going to get my hands dirty and do it from scratch from one neuron (or unit) to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). I'm going to write things that works and things that don't. This will be a long journey. So, bear with me.

To understand the fundamentals, we also need to learn Mathematics for Machine Learning. From my prespective, We don't need to learn the mathematics first. We'll learn as we go. You might think that learning mathematics will be boring or scary if you are like me but if we ask "why" we need to learn a particular concept and "how" it works exactly then trust me, it'll be interesting. So let's start from the start. I'll use NN(s) abbreviation for Neural Network(s).

First of all let's understand what is a Machine Learning model or algorithm.
